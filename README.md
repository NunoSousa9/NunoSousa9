## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm JosÃ© Nuno Sousa, 34y/o from Maia(Porto, Portugal) and I am a recent graduate of a 14-week intensive Fullstack Development program at Academia de CÃ³digo(Code_for_All). 
I acquired solid skills in various technologies, including Java, JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and SQL. I've also completed a React.js course in the same Academy. 
Here are some projects I've done throughout this yet short programming journey...feel free to check them out :)
